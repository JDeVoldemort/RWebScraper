# Overview

I did this project as a method of practicing the R programming language and learning more about using web scrapers.

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the R language.}

The purpose of writing this software was to try using a webscraper and use the R lauguage. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
